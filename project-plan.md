# SoVerySocial Development Plan

This document outlines our lean development approach for building SoVerySocial. We'll build features incrementally, focusing on delivering working software early and adapting based on feedback.

## Core Principles
- [x] Deliver working software early and frequently
- [x] Build minimum viable features and iterate
- [x] Focus on user value with each iteration
- [x] Adapt based on feedback

## Iteration 1: Minimum Viable Feed (1-2 weeks)
- [x] Create basic Next.js project structure
- [x] Implement minimal UI for displaying posts
- [ ] Set up simplified MongoDB with mock post data
- [x] Deploy simple read-only version locally

## Iteration 2: User Authentication (1 week)
- [ ] Add authentication system (NextAuth.js) 
- [ ] Create user database schema
- [ ] Implement registration and login flows
- [ ] Connect authentication to existing feed

## Iteration 3: Post Creation (1 week)
- [ ] Build post creation UI component
- [ ] Create API endpoint for post creation
- [ ] Connect post creation to user accounts
- [ ] Update feed to display user-created content

## Iteration 4: User Profiles (1 week)
- [ ] Create profile page component
- [ ] Add profile edit functionality
- [ ] Display user's posts on their profile
- [ ] Implement basic profile customization

## Iteration 5: Social Interactions - Part 1 (1 week)
- [ ] Implement follow/unfollow functionality
- [ ] Modify feed algorithm to show followed users' content
- [ ] Create API endpoints for follow relationships
- [ ] Add followed users list to profiles

## Iteration 6: Social Interactions - Part 2 (1 week)
- [ ] Add like functionality to posts
- [ ] Implement comment UI and backend
- [ ] Create notification schema for interactions
- [ ] Display like and comment counts

## Iteration 7: Image Uploads (1 week)
- [ ] Set up cloud storage integration
- [ ] Implement image upload in post creation
- [ ] Add image display in feed and profiles
- [x] Handle image optimization with Next.js

## Iteration 8: Search Functionality (1 week)
- [ ] Implement basic search UI
- [ ] Create search API endpoints
- [ ] Add user and post search capabilities
- [ ] Display search results effectively

## Iteration 9: Notifications (1 week)
- [ ] Build notification UI components
- [ ] Implement real-time notification delivery
- [ ] Create notification settings
- [ ] Add notification badges and indicators

## Iteration 10: Refinement (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Analyze user behavior and feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Add requested features from early users

## Process Guidelines for Each Iteration
- [x] Begin with a planning session
- [ ] Include continuous integration and testing
- [x] End with a working deployment
- [ ] Incorporate user feedback into the next iteration

## Development Environment Setup
- [x] Install Node.js and npm
- [x] Configure Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up proper image domain configuration
- [x] Successfully run the application locally

## Notes
- This plan is flexible and may be adjusted as we learn and gather feedback
- Technical decisions should prioritize delivering value quickly while maintaining quality
- Regularly revisit and update this checklist as we progress
